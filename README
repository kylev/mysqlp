This is an experimental pure Python driver for access to the
open-source MySQL RDBMS.  Its aim is to follow the Python DBAPI 2.0
(PEP 249) and provide a robust environment in situations where the
native driver (MySQLdb) is difficult to use.  This may include such
esoteric environments as PyPy, Jython, Twisted or other environments
where compiling the native MySQL libraries is problematic (such as a
Windows or OSX machine lacking sufficient development tools).

!!! IMPORTANT !!!

This driver is in a embryonic state, incomplete, and utterly
unreliable.  There is no telling what it may do to you or your data.
You may lose rows, tables, databases, or entire computers.  It may
impregnate your dog.  It might steal Christmas.  It could ruin
lasange.

Do not use this driver.  It is an as-yet incomplete programming
exercise for the author.
